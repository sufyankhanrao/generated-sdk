The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from greenbyteapi.configuration import Environment
from greenbyteapi.greenbyteapi_client import GreenbyteapiClient
from greenbyteapi.http.auth.custom_header_authentication import CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials

client = GreenbyteapiClient(
    custom_header_authentication_credentials=CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials(
        x_api_key='X-Api-Key'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION,
    customer='intro'
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from greenbyteapi.greenbyteapi_client import GreenbyteapiClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = GreenbyteapiClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.

## Greenbyte API Client

The gateway for the SDK. This class acts as a factory for the Controllers and also holds the configuration of the SDK.

| data | Gets DataController |
| statuses | Gets StatusesController |
| configuration_data | Gets ConfigurationDataController |
| assets | Gets AssetsController |
| alerts | Gets AlertsController |
| plan | Gets PlanController |
| predict | Gets PredictController |
