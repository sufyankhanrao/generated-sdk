The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from mindbodypublicapi.configuration import Environment
from mindbodypublicapi.http.auth.custom_header_authentication import CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials
from mindbodypublicapi.mindbodypublicapi_client import MindbodypublicapiClient

client = MindbodypublicapiClient(
    custom_header_authentication_credentials=CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials(
        api_key='API-Key'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from mindbodypublicapi.mindbodypublicapi_client import MindbodypublicapiClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = MindbodypublicapiClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
