        agreement_date (datetime): The date and time at which the client
            agreed to the liability waiver for the business.
        is_released (bool): The client’s liability release status.<br />  When
            `true`, indicates that the client has agreed to the liability
            release for the business.<br />  When `false`, indicates that the
            client has not agreed to the liability release for the business.
        released_by (int): An ID indicating who released liability for the
            client. If the client agreed to the liability waiver by signing
            into an account online, this value is `null`. If a staff member
            marked the waiver as signed on behalf of the client, it is the
            staff member’s ID. `0` indicates that the business owner marked
            the liability waiver as signed on behalf of the client.
