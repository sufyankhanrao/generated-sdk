        country (str): The client’s country.
        creation_date (datetime): The date the client’s profile was created

            the passed index value. You cannot currently remove client indexes
            using the Public API. Only the indexes passed in the request are
            returned in the response.
        client_relationships (List[ClientRelationship]): Contains information
            about the relationship between two clients.    This parameter does

            client-related Public API calls. When used in a POST

            for the update.
        is_company (bool): When `true`, indicates that the client should be
            marked as a company at the business.<br />  When `false`,

            allows individuals to be prospects.<br />  When `true`, indicates

            call was processed.  * `ReleasedBy` is set to `null` if the call
            is made by the client, `0` if the call was made by the business
            owner, or to a specific staff member’s ID if a staff member made
            the call.  Passing `false` sets the client’s liability information
            as follows:  * `IsReleased` is set to `false`.  * `AgreementDate`
            is set to `null`.  * `ReleasedBy` is set to `null`.

            This value cannot be changed by business owners and is always
            unique across all clients at the business. This ID is not widely
            used in the Public API, but can be used by your application to
            uniquely identify clients.
        last_modified_date_time (datetime): The UTC date and time when the
