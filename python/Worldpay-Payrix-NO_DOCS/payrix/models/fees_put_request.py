        collection_factor (int): A multiplier that you can use to adjust the
            set of data to be used in the collection calculation.  This field
            is specified as an integer and its value determines the period of
            time to be used.
        collection_offset (int): The number of days, weeks, months or years to
            go back when selecting data for collection calculation.
        collection_include_current (int): Whether to include the current
            period for the colleciton calculation.
        um (FeeUmEnum): The unit of measure for this Fee.  Notes:    *
            Percentage and Surcharge units will only apply to Fee schedules
            set to trigger from monetary events, such as an authorization,
            capture, or refund.  <details> <summary>Valid Values</summary>  -
            `1` - **Percentage.** The Fee is a percentage of the related event
            amount, specified in the 'amount' field in basis points.  - `2` -
            **Fixed Amount.** The Fee is a fixed amount, specified in the
            'amount' field as an integer in cents.  - `3` - **Surcharge.** The
            Fee is a percentage of the related event amount as a surcharge
            (the calculated amount will be based on the assumption that the
            related event amount already contains the fee amount in it),
            specified in the 'amount' field in basis points.  </details>
        amount (float): The total amount of this Fee.  The units used in this
            field are determined by the value of the 'um' field on the Fee. If
            the 'um' field is set to 'percentage', then this field specifies
            the Fee percentage to levy in basis points. If the 'um' field is
            set to 'amount', then this field specifies the Fee in cents(up to
            three decimal points)
        maximum (float): The maximum amount to charge for this fee when
            setting a percent-based fee.   * Will be `null` for all other
            units.
        currency (CurrencyEnum): The currency of the amount in the fees
            resource. See <a href="https://www.iban.com/currency-codes"
            target="_blank">Currency codes</a>  for all valid values.
        txn_fee (TxnFeeEnum): Indicator to extract fee from txn supplied fee.
            When set, amount will correspond to the fee amount in the txn and
            only that amount will be extractable, anything over that amount
            will not be extracted. <details><summary>Valid Values</summary>  -
            `0` - **Disabled.** Fee will be calculated normally.  - `1` -
            **Enabled.** Fee will be calculated based on transaction fee.  
            </details>
        inactive (InactiveEnum): Whether this resource is marked as inactive. 
            <details> <summary>Valid Values</summary>  - `0` - **Active** -
            `1` - **Inactive**  </details>
        frozen (FrozenEnum): Whether this resource is marked as frozen.
