            the amount set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.

            same as the amount set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare
            Rule.
        NOTEQUAL: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry amount is not
            exactly equal to the amount set in the 'value' field of the
            ProfitShare Rule.
        GREATER: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry amount is higher
            than the amount set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
        EVENT: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry event is exactly the
            same as the event set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
        NOTEVENT: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry event is not
            exactly equal to the event set in the 'value' field of the
            ProfitShare Rule.
        FEE: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry fee is exactly the same
            as the fee set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
        NOTFEE: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry fee is not exactly
            equal to the fee set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
        FROMENTITY: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry fromentity (or
            opposingEntryfromentity) is exactly the same as the entity set in
            the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
        NOTFROMENTITY: The ProfitShare applies only if the entry fromentity
            (or opposingEntryfromentity) is not exactly equal to the entity
            set in the 'value' field of the ProfitShare Rule.
