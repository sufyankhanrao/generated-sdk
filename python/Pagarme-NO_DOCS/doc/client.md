The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from pagarmeapisdk.configuration import Environment
from pagarmeapisdk.http.auth.basic_auth import BasicAuthCredentials
from pagarmeapisdk.pagarmeapisdk_client import PagarmeapisdkClient

client = PagarmeapisdkClient(
    service_referer_name='ServiceRefererName',
    basic_auth_credentials=BasicAuthCredentials(
        username='BasicAuthUserName',
        password='BasicAuthPassword'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from pagarmeapisdk.pagarmeapisdk_client import PagarmeapisdkClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = PagarmeapisdkClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
