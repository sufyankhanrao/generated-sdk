The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from advancedbilling.advanced_billing_client import AdvancedBillingClient
from advancedbilling.configuration import Environment
from advancedbilling.http.auth.basic_auth import BasicAuthCredentials

client = AdvancedBillingClient(
    basic_auth_credentials=BasicAuthCredentials(
        username='BasicAuthUserName',
        password='BasicAuthPassword'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION,
    subdomain='subdomain',
    domain='chargify.com'
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from advancedbilling.advanced_billing_client import AdvancedBillingClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = AdvancedBillingClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
