The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from foxitesigntest.configuration import Environment
from foxitesigntest.foxitesigntest_client import FoxitesigntestClient
from foxitesigntest.http.auth.o_auth_2 import BearerAuthCredentials

client = FoxitesigntestClient(
    bearer_auth_credentials=BearerAuthCredentials(
        access_token='AccessToken'
    ),
    environment=Environment.US_SERVER
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from foxitesigntest.foxitesigntest_client import FoxitesigntestClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = FoxitesigntestClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
