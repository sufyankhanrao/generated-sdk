    A list of recipient parties you're sending the folder to. Every entry must

    Attributes:
        action (str): Value can be either update or change. *Note:* 'update'
            value can be used for Draft, Shared, Partially Signed folders.
            'change' value can be used only in the Draft status folders.
        first_name (str): The first name of the recipient
        last_name (str): The last name of the recipient
        email_id (str): The email name of the recipient
        sequence (int): Use this field to assign a sequence number to a
            recipient in the list of recipient parties. Use unique sequence
            numbers for each party starting with 1 like 1,2,3,4.... If a
            single person appears multiple times in the signing workflow,
