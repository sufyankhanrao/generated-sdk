# Risk Profile 7

Defines the user’s risk profile. Note that Risk Profiles are mapped to portfolio access. For example, a Conservative investor has access to portfolios 1-8 (or 50% Equity) while an Aggressive investor has access to all 16 portfolios (up to 90% Equity). <br> On a default basis, GOE is configured for three Risk Profile levels, but it can be customized for up to five levels.

*This model accepts additional fields of type Any.*
