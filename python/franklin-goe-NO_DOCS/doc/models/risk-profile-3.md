# Risk Profile 3

Defines the user’s risk profile. Note that Risk Profiles are mapped to portfolio access.  <br>             For example, a Conservative investor has access to portfolios 1-8 (or 50% Equity) while an Aggressive  <br>             investor has access to all 16 portfolios (up to 90% Equity). This is configurable.

*This model accepts additional fields of type Any.*
