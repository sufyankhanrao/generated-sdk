# Infusion Type 1

Defines the duration between each infusion the investor makes. If set to 'yearly', the investor makes an infusion every year on the same day of the year. Setting this to 'monthly' means the infusion is made every month, on the same day of the month. Idiosyncrasies in the calendar, such as 28/29/30/31 day months and leap years are already considered.
