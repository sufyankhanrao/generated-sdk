    """Implementation of the 'Infusions' model.

    Attributes:
        min (int): The minimum amount of funds that the investor is willing to
            place at a chosen (monthly/yearly) interval. The investor will
            place these funds starting one interval period (i.e. one
            month/year) after the initial investment is placed into the fund
            until one interval period before the final withdrawal takes place
            (i.e. before the end of the goal tenure). For example, an investor
            with a five-year goal tenure and yearly infusions of $1000 will
            contribute $1000 at years 2, 3, and 4 of the goal tenure.
        max (int): The maximum amount of funds that the investor is willing to
            place at a chosen (monthly/yearly) interval. The investor will
            place these funds starting one interval period (i.e. one
            month/year) after the initial investment is placed into the fund
            until one interval period before the final withdrawal takes place
