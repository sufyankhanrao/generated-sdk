class GoalProfile(object):

    """Implementation of the 'GoalProfile' model.

    Attributes:
        goal_id (str): Goal identifier for individual goal.
        goal_amt (List[float]): Accumulation only Goals:              Target
            wealth value associated with the goal at end of goal
            tenure.<br><br>              Accumulation & Decumulation, and
            decumulation/income goals: goal value (withdrawal) each year      
            during the decumulation period. For subsequent calls, the goalAmt
            list needs to be updated based on the time that has elapsed.
        start_date (str): Accumulation Goals: beginning date of the goal -
            this is typically the date of initial investment for accumulation
            goals. For subsequent calls, the original start date for the goal
            needs to be passed.                           <br>Accumulation &
            Decumulation, and decumulation/income goals: date when the first
            withdrawal/income starts. For subsequent calls, the original start
            date (date of first withdrawal) for the goal needs to be passed.
        end_date (str): Accumulation Goals: end date of the goal - when a
            lumpsum is due.                         <br>Accumulation &
            Decumulation, and decumulation/income goals: date of last
            withdrawal.
        priority (str): Defines the importance a goal holds for a specific
            user.          Order of priority is Need > Want > Wish > Dream.
            Goal priority defines the target probabilities and             the
            loss threshold values. For example, goals with a higher priority
            (e.g. Need) would have a                  higher target goal
            probability (85%) with a higher (aggressive) loss threshold value.
        scenario_type (str): ‘regular’ for regular goals accumulation goals
            where cash flows are positive (contributions)             and with
            a typical target wealth.<br><br>            ‘retirement’ for
            scenarios where a decumulation period is included: <br>           
            1. Scenarios with an accumulation period (and an initial wealth) &
            positive cash flows followed by                 a decumulation
            period with withdrawals (negative cash flows) with or without an
            inheritance.<br>                    2. Scenarios with an initial
            wealth followed by a decumulation period with or without an
            inheritance.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
