    """Implementation of the 'GoalTenure2' model.

    Defines the duration, in years, between the initial investment being
    placed in the portfolio and the investor's last withdrawal (at which point
    the funds in the portfolio are zero). The investor may make infusions
    during this time into/out of the portfolio. The `min`/`max` values
    represent the minimum and maximum goal tenures that the investor is
    considering. The `max` value must be more or equal to the `min` value, and
    the `min` value must be positive.

    Attributes:
        min (int): The minimum duration, in years, between the initial
            investment being placed in the portfolio and the investor's date
            of last withdrawal. The investor may make infusions during this
            time into/out of the portfolio. This value must be a positive
            integer.
        max (int): The maximum duration, in years, between the initial
            investment being placed in the portfolio and the investor's date
            of last withdrawal. The investor may make infusions during this
            time into/out of the portfolio. This value must be more or equal
