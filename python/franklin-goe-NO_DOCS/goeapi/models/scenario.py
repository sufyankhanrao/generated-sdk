class Scenario(object):
    """Implementation of the 'Scenario' model.

    Attributes:
        initial_investment (float): The initial amount of funds placed by the
            investor at the beginning of the goal tenure.
        target_wealth (float): The amount of funds at the end of the goal
            tenure.
        goal_tenure (int): The duration, in years, between the initial
            investment being placed in the portfolio and the investor's last
            withdrawal from the portfolio (at which point the funds in the
            portfolio are zero).
        irr (float): The internal rate of return of the portfolio that is
            required to attain the target wealth at the end of the goal
            tenure, given the cash flows resulting from the investor's
            infusions.
        infusions (float): The cash flows into/out of the portfolio from the
            investor at the chosen (monthly or yearly) interval. The investor
            will place these funds starting one interval period (i.e. one
            month/year) after the initial investment is placed into the fund
            until one interval period before the final withdrawal takes place
            (i.e. before the end of the goal tenure). For example, an investor
            with a five-year goal tenure and yearly infusions of $1000 will
            contribute $1000 at years 2, 3, and 4 of the goal tenure.
        goal_probability (int): The probability that the target wealth will be
            achieved at the end of the goal tenure.
        portfolio_id (int): The ID of the portfolio that corresponds to this
            scenario.
        goal_priority (int): Defines the importance of achieving the goal for
            the investor. The importance increases in the following order:
            Desire > Dream > Wish > Want > Need. The investor can select
            multiple importances. Selecting more importances will result in
            more scenarios being returned.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
