class Page2(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Page2' model.

    Contains details about the number of scenarios returned, the current page,
    and the total number of scenarios and pages that pertain to these
    investors preferences. Refer to the Swagger documentation for Page objects
    for more details.

    Attributes:
        per_page (int): The number of scenarios returned in this response
            (equal to the number of elements in the data array). Each scenario
            is returned as a JSON object. Typically, a larger page size lowers
            the time taken to receive all the results, but increases the time
            to receive each page of data.
        id (int): A 1-indexed number that identifies the page being returned:
            for example, a pageIndex of 1 returns the first page of scenarios
            from the Goal Discovery Service
        total_records (int): The total number of scenarios corresponding to
            this request that can be returned by the Goal Discovery service.
            This corresponds to the number of JSON elements in the data array.
        total_pages (int): The total number of pages corresponding to this
            request that can be returned by the Goal Discovery service. Each
            page has `perPage` scenarios on it.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
