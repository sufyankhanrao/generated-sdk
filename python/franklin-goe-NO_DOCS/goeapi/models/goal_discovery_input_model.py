class GoalDiscoveryInputModel(object):

    """Implementation of the 'GoalDiscoveryInputModel' model.

    Attributes:
        goal_type (GoalType): Defines the investor's goal for a portfolio.
            Only portfolios that correspond to the investor's goal are
            returned. The investor can only select one of 'retirement' or
            'wealth'.
        risk_profile (RiskProfile1): Defines the risk the investor is willing
            to take; the returned scenarios are chosen/tailored based on this
            risk. Risk profiles represent increasing risk in the following
            order: conservative > conservatively moderate > moderate >
            moderately aggressive > aggressive. The investor may only choose
            one risk profile.
        initial_investment (InitialInvestment2): Defines a range of possible
            initial investments the investor will make. The `min`/`max`
            amounts represent the minimum and maximum amounts of funds
            respectively that the investor will place into the portfolio at
            the beginning of the goal tenure.
        goal_priority (List[GoalDiscoveryGoalPriorityAttribute]): Defines the
            importance of achieving the goal for the investor. The importance
            increases in the following order: Desire > Dream > Wish > Want >
            Need. The investor can select multiple importances. Selecting more
            importances will result in more scenarios being returned.
        infusion_type (InfusionType1): Defines the duration between each
            infusion the investor makes. If set to 'yearly', the investor
            makes an infusion every year on the same day of the year. Setting
            this to 'monthly' means the infusion is made every month, on the
            same day of the month. Idiosyncrasies in the calendar, such as
            28/29/30/31 day months and leap years are already considered.
        infusions (Infusions2): Defines the amount of funds that the investor
            is willing to place at a chosen (monthly/yearly) interval. The
            investor will place these funds starting one interval period (i.e.
            one month/year) after the initial investment is placed into the
            fund until one interval period before the final withdrawal takes
            place (i.e. before the end of the goal tenure). For example, an
            investor with a five-year goal tenure and yearly infusions of
            $1000 will contribute $1000 at years 2, 3, and 4 of the goal
            tenure. The `min`/`max` values represent the minimum and maximum
            infusion amounts respectively that the investor is willing to make
            into the portfolio.
        goal_tenure (GoalTenure2): Defines the duration, in years, between the
            initial investment being placed in the portfolio and the
            investor's last withdrawal (at which point the funds in the
            portfolio are zero). The investor may make infusions during this
            time into/out of the portfolio. The `min`/`max` values represent
            the minimum and maximum goal tenures that the investor is
            considering. The `max` value must be more or equal to the `min`
            value, and the `min` value must be positive.
        target_wealth (TargetWealth2): Defines the amount that the investor is
            willing to set as their target wealth in their portfolio at the
            end of the (maximum length) goal tenure. The `min`/`max` values
            represent the minimum and maximum target wealth values
            respectively. The `max` value must be more than or equal to the
            `min` value.
        page_size (int): Defines the number of scenarios to be returned on one
            page. Each scenario is returned as a JSON object. Typically, a
            larger page size lowers the time taken to receive all the results,
            but increases the time to receive each page of data.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
