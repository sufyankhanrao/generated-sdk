class GoeToAnalysisReport(object):

    """Implementation of the 'GoeToAnalysisReport' model.

    Attributes:
        advisor_discretion_report (Any): Recommended Portfolio and
            corresponding probability.  <br>                    In case where
            current portfolio is not null, it provides the following:  <br>   
            1. Probability of attaining goal (using the current portfolio sent
            as an input and a constant portfolio path) – Monte Carlo
            simulations  <br>                    2. Current Goal Probability
            (dynamic asset allocation by GOE) and the recommended portfolio
            <br>                    In case the current portfolio is null, the
            current goal probability is displayed (using dynamic asset
            allocation by GOE and not assuming a constant portfolio path)
            along with the recommended portfolio.
        bankruptcy_msg (str): Message flagging an expected bankruptcy (goal
            running out of money) in any year. <br>                    Note: 
            <br>                    If ‘NA’, bankruptcy is unlikely to happen
            during the goal tenure. <br>                    In bankruptcy
            cases, response would be of the format:  <br>                   
            There is more than 75% probability of going bankrupt after year 10
        current_goal_probability (float): GOE’s estimated probability to
            achieve the goal target wealth. <br>                    Note: 
            <br>                    To be displayed as 63% (rounded with no
            decimals)
        expected_taxes_for_current_year (GoeToExpectedTaxesForCurrentYear2):
            Details of the taxes as received from LifeYield. <br>             
            Note: <br>                    The taxes pertain to accounts that
            are under GOE’s discretion & are computed, in this dictionary,
            only for current financial year.
        is_goal_realistic (bool): To understand if the goal probability is
            more                     than 35% (This is a configurable field).
            <br>                    Note: If ‘false’, goal is                 
            unrealistic.
        loss_threshold (float): The model property of type float.
        meet_goal_priority (bool): Checks if goal probability is more than the
            target probability corresponding to the goal                    
            priority – Target probabilities for all goal                    
            priorities (Need, Want, Wish and Dream) are                    
            set in the GOE config. <br>                     Note: If ‘true’,
            goal                     probability achieves the                 
            target probability.                     If ‘false’, goal
            probability                     falls short of the target         
            probability.
        meet_loss_priority (bool): Checks if loss probability is at least 95% 
            (target can be set in the GOE config). <br>                   
            Note:  <br>                    If true, estimated                 
            loss probability meets                     the target loss        
            probability.
        one_time_top_up (Any): Recommendations based on available accounts.
            Two objectives of recommendations: <br>                    1.
            Ensure the probability of withdrawal from the taxable account is
            greater than the priority of the goal (pre-59.5Y). This is
            applicable if the user has taxable account with TDA / Roth
            account. <br>                    2. Add money to the retirement
            accounts if the current threshold for contributing to retirement
            accounts is not met.
        p_delta_current_goal_probability (float): Estimated goal probability
            considering the                     swing constraint. Since this
            is a simulation,                     the output might differ
            slightly on each                     simulation run.
        p_delta_current_loss_threshold_probability (float): The model property
            of type float.
        proposed_trades_current_year (ProposedTradesCurrentYearInfo2): Details
            of trade as of today i.e., current date & end of the year
        recommended_portfolio_id (int): GOE’s current recommended portfolio
            index. <br>                    Note: Can be between 1             
            to 16. Also subject to                     investor’s risk
            profile: for                     example, conservative            
            investors have access to                    1-8 portfolios while  
            Aggressive investors have                     access to 1-16.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
