    Attributes:
        goal_id (str): Uniquely identifies a goal
        start_date (str): Start date of the withdrawals
        end_date (str): End date of the withdrawals
        priority (str): Used to classify a goal in, usually, one of the
            following categories.  <br>                        Priority
            Name&emsp; Desired Probability  <br>

            Dream&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;50%  <br>                        The
            priority of a goal affects the recommendation. The recommendation
            is calibrated to the desired probability of a priority. <br>
            Note:  <br>                        In case of multiple goals, the
            priority of the plan is determined by the highest priority goal
            within the plan
        goal_purpose (str): Used to especially identify “education” goals
            i.e., 529 accounts.                        For MVP, this field has
            no impact on computations.
        goal_amt (List[float]): List of withdrawals associated with a goal.
            The first withdrawal occurs on the “startDate”. The last
            withdrawal occurs on “endDate”. <br>
            Important  <br>                        All intermittent
            withdrawals are assumed to occur on the “cashflowDate”
        scenario_type (str): “regular” or “retirement” depending on the type
            of goal.                        A regular goal often has a single
            withdrawal while a retirement goal has series of withdrawals.

            the model.
