class GoalProfileListWealthSplitterModel(object):

    """Implementation of the 'GoalProfileListWealthSplitterModel' model.

    Attributes:
        goal_id (str): Unique identifier for each goal
        goal_value (float): Target goal amount
        purpose (str): Type of goal (for example, ‘Children’s education,
            Vacation, etc.’)
        curr_wealth (float): Current wealth allocated for the goal when the
            Initial Wealth Splitter is being called or executed.
        cashflow_date (str): Cashflow date of the goal - this is the date
            (year is ignored) on which infusions/withdrawals                  
            would be realized for the goal. Format is "dd-mm-yyyy" <br>       
            If not passed or value is null, the algorithm would consider the
            first reallocation date as the cashflow date.
        loss_threshold (float): Loss threshold value – the wealth amount that
            the investor does not want to end up below at the end of the goal
            tenure.<br>                                                 If not
            passed or value is ‘null’, the GOE algo would calculate the loss
            threshold. If a number value is passed, GOE would consider that
            amount as the loss threshold.<br>                                 
            If loss threshold is not available, this needs to be passed as
            ‘null’, and GOE would calculate the loss threshold and return as a
            part of the response ‘loss threshold’. <br>                       
            This amount needs to be stored, and should be passed as
            ‘lossThreshold’ on subsequent GOE calls.
        goal_priority (WeathSplitterGoalPriorityAttribute): Defines the
            importance a goal holds for a specific user. Order of priority is
            Need > Want > Wish > Dream <br>         goalPriority can be from 1
            to 4 levels. However, note that Goal priority defines the target
            probabilities and the loss threshold values.<br>         For
            example, goals with a higher priority (e.g. Need) would have a
            higher target goal probability (85%) with a higher (aggressive)
            loss threshold value (slightly more than IW value) in the current
            set-up.<br>         This needs to be re-mapped based on the number
            of goal-priority levels, in case of a change.
        cashflow_type (str): Describes the cash flow frequency. <br>          
            Valid input is ‘yearly’ or ‘monthly’. <br>                        
            This parameter is provided to account for real-world investors who
            might put in monthly infusions as opposed to yearly infusions.<br>
            Monthly infusions would be smaller in value (and hence easier to
            commit to) vs. yearly infusions.
        cashflow (List[float]): Cashflow array – includes any cash infusions
            and/or withdrawals; length would depend on cashflow_type and the
            goal tenure
        end_date (str): Defines the end date of goal.Valid input format is
            date – ‘dd-mm-yyyy’
        scenario_type (str): Determines the type of the scenario, the
            suggested portfolio and the wealth glide path is created
            accordingly. <br>                                            
            ‘regular’ for regular goals accumulation goals where cash flows
            are positive (contributions) and with a typical target wealth <br>
            ‘retirement’ for scenarios where a decumulation period is
            included: <br>                                             1.
            Scenarios with an accumulation period (and an initial wealth) &
            positive cash flows followed by a decumulation period with
            withdrawals (negative cash flows) with or without an inheritance
            <br>                                             2. Scenarios with
            an initial wealth followed by a decumulation period with or
            without an inheritance
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
