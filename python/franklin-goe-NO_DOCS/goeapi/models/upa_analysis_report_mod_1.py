    """Implementation of the 'UPAAnalysisReportMod1' model.

    <b>For the modified Plan:</b><br>            GOE’s outputs including
    probability, portfolio advice, etc.

    Attributes:
        current_goal_probability (float): GOE’s estimated probability to
            achieve the goal target wealth
        current_loss_threshold_probability (float): GOE’s estimated
            probability to remain above the loss threshold amount by the end
            of the goal tenure.
        p_delta_current_goal_probability (float): Estimated goal probability
            considering the swing constraint. Since this is a simulation,
            the output might differ slightly on each simulation run.
        p_delta_current_loss_threshold_probability (float): Similar to above,
            this is the loss threshold probability considering swing
            constraint.                     Since this is a simulation, the
            output might differ slightly on each simulation run.
        recommended_portfolio_id (int): GOE’s current recommended portfolio
            index.
        meet_goal_priority (bool): Checks if goal probability is more than the
            target probability corresponding to the goal             priority
            – Target probabilities for all goal priorities (Need, Want, Wish
            and Dream) are set in the GOE config.
        is_goal_realistic (bool): To understand if the goal probability is
            more than 35% (This is a configurable field).
        meet_loss_priority (bool): Checks if loss probability is at least 95%
            (target can be set in the GOE config).
        one_time_top_up (float): Suggested one-time top-up amount that aims to
            improve the goal probability to meet the target goal probability.
        cashflow_recommendation (CashflowRecommendation1): Cashflow
            recommendation is at the plan level.Note: -               Empty in
            case plan meets the target probability.
        bankruptcy_msg (str): Message flagging an expected bankruptcy (goal
            running out of money) in any year.
        advisor_discretion_report (Dict[str, float]): Recommended Portfolio
            and corresponding probability. In case where current portfolio is
            not null,                    it provides the following:<br> 1.
            Probability of attaining goal                     (using the
            current portfolio sent as an input and a constant portfolio path)
            – Monte Carlo simulations.<br>2. Current Goal Probability (dynamic
            asset allocation by GOE)                              and the
            recommended portfolio.<br>In case the current portfolio is null,
            the current goal probability is displayed (using dynamic asset
            allocation                                      by GOE and not
            assuming a constant portfolio path) along with
            the recommended portfolio
        loss_threshold (int): Loss threshold value – the wealth amount that
            the investor does not want to end up below             at the end
            of the goal tenure. The GOE algo calculates the loss threshold if
            not provided.
        goals_response (List[UpaGoalResponse]): The model property of type
            List[UpaGoalResponse].
        comments (str): Comment would describe the modifications or % change
            in goal amount made to original goal amounts to meet the target
            goal probability.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
