    """Implementation of the 'RiskProfile3' enum.

    Defines the user’s risk profile. Note that Risk Profiles are mapped to
    portfolio access.  <br>             For example, a Conservative investor
    has access to portfolios 1-8 (or 50% Equity) while an Aggressive  <br>    
    investor has access to all 16 portfolios (up to 90% Equity). This is
    configurable.

    Attributes:
        CONSERVATIVE: The enum member of type str.
        MODERATE: The enum member of type str.
        AGGRESSIVE: The enum member of type str.
