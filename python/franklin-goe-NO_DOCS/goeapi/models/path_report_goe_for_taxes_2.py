    """Implementation of the 'PathReportGoeForTaxes2' model.

    Forward looking estimates of likely portfolios,                    
    wealth, withdrawals, and taxes

    Attributes:
        early_withdrawal_penalty (float): 10% penalty if the expected path has
            an early                     withdrawal incidence from the Roth
            account.
        ending_wealth (Any): Estimate of the ending wealth as of end of the   
            year after accounting for all the infusions and                   
            withdrawals in the year. <br>                    Three estimates: 
            “expected”, “optimistic”, and “pessimistic.”
        expected_tax_amount (float): Expected Taxes due to following: <br>    
            - Withdrawals <br>                    - Social Security <br>      
            - RMD <br>
        goal_amount (float): Post-tax withdrawal as requested by the          
            participant for a given period
        period (int): Represents a financial year.<br>                   
            Note:<br>                    Period 1: represents the current
            financial year.
        portfolio_id (int): Portfolio number for a given period
        rmd_amount (List[RmdAmount]): Represents the RMD amount for a given
            period                    (if applicable).                    This
            is based on the projected balance of the                     TDA
            account as of 31st December of the                     preceding
            year.
        social_security_amount (List[RmdAmount]): Social security amounts to
            be received for each                     participant in a given
            period.                     This amount is not an optimized
            amount, but                     an amount derived based on the
            custom age                     specified by the participant.      
            Please note that the social security amount is                    
            pre-tax
        withdrawal_amount (Any): Three elements are part of the
            dictionary:<br>                    “taxableAccount”: withdrawal
            from taxable  account. <br>                    “tdaAmount”:
            withdrawal from TDA account. <br>                   
            “rothAccount”: withdrawal from Roth account. <br>                 
            The withdrawal sequencing is following: <br>                   
            Social Security (if any), RMD (if any), Taxable account, TDA
            account, and Roth Account                    In case of taxable
            accounts, due to the unpredictable nature of capital gains, the   
            desired withdrawal is taxed, but the taxes are not sourced.
            However, for TDA accounts, due to the                    
            predictability of the taxes - the withdrawals are escalated for
            taxes.
        additional_properties (Dict[str, Any]): The additional properties for
            the model.
