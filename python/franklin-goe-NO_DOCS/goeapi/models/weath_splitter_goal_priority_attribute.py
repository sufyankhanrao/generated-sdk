class WeathSplitterGoalPriorityAttribute(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Weath Splitter goalPriority attribute' enum.

    Defines the importance a goal holds for a specific user. Order of priority
    is Need > Want > Wish > Dream <br>         goalPriority can be from 1 to 4
    levels. However, note that Goal priority defines the target probabilities
    and the loss threshold values.<br>         For example, goals with a
    higher priority (e.g. Need) would have a higher target goal probability
    (85%) with a higher (aggressive) loss threshold value (slightly more than
    IW value) in the current set-up.<br>         This needs to be re-mapped
    based on the number of goal-priority levels, in case of a change.

    Attributes:
        NEED: The enum member of type str.
        WANT: The enum member of type str.
        WISH: The enum member of type str.
        DREAM: The enum member of type str.
