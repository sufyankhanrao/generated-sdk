    Request to update contact information.

    Attributes:
        primary_place_of_use (PlaceOfUse): The customer name and the address
            of the device's primary place of use. Leave these fields empty to
            use the account profile address as the primary place of use. These
            values will be applied to all devices in the request.If the
            account is enabled for non-geographic MDNs and the device supports
            it, the primaryPlaceOfUse address will also be used to derive the
            MDN for the device.
        account_name (str): The name of the billing account that the devices
            belong to. An account name is usually numeric, and must include
            any leading zeros.
        devices (List[AccountDeviceList]): A list of the devices that you want
            to change, specified by device identifier. You only need to
            provide one identifier per device. Do not include accountName,
            groupName, customFields, or servicePlan if you use this parameter.
