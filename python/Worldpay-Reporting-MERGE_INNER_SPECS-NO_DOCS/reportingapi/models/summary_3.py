    """Implementation of the 'Summary3' model.

    Attributes:
        approved_count (int): Count of Approved Transactions.
        approved_amount (float): Sum of Amount of Approved Transactions.
        declined_count (int): Count of Declined Transactions.
        declined_amount (float): Sum of Amount of Declined Transactions.
        approved_count_percent (float): Ratio of Count of Approved
            Transactions to the Count of Total Transctions.
        approved_amount_percent (float): Ratio of the Sum of Amount of
            Approved Transactions to the Sum of Amount of Total Transctions.
        declined_count_percent (float): Ratio of Count of Declined
            Transactions to the Count of Total Transctions.
        declined_amount_percent (float): Ratio of the Sum of Amount of
            Declined Transactions to the Sum of Amount of Total Transctions.
        chain_code (str): The Chain Code is the level of the merchant
            hierarchy that groups merchant identifiers (MIDs) and any related
            roll-up values under a common identifier for settlement, billing
            and reporting. Chain Code is the primary identifier for merchants
            boarded in MDB (Merchant Database) system.
        division_number (str): The Division Number is a hierarchy level that
            enables merchants to roll-up child entities for Stores / Locations
            into different groups under a Chain. The Division Code is an
            optional hierarchy level but if created, is required for all child
            entities under the Division Number. <br> Supports entities Chain,
            National.
